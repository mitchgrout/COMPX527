1) If this is a fresh pull, start by running ./first_run, otherwise go to 3)

2) You now have a public/private key pair stored in deploy/deployer{,.pub}
   If you want to rename/move these, you will need to change some files

3) Check deploy/vars.tf to see if there's anything that needs to be changed for your system
   - whitelisted_ip_blocks:    
       the IPs allowed to talk to our instances
   - deployer_public_key_path: 
       a path, relative to deploy/, pointing to your public key
   - server_port:              
       the port which the web server will be run on
   - instance_count:           
       the number of EC2 instances to start 
 
4) Run ./create_infrastructure to construct the specified number of EC2 instances,
   automatically attach them to the load balancer, and set up your created keys. 
   This should be run once

5) Run ./start_services to bootstrap each of these systems via ansible. 
   This should be run once

6) Run ./update_html to automatically copy the html/ file to the servers

7) If manual management is required, use ./ssh_into [n] to connect to instance number n

8) Use ./destroy_infrastructure to tear everything down
